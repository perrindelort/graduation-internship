# What's in there?
This repository contains my graduation internship's report and oral presentation.
Both of them have been anonymized, and these changes have been approved by GTT before being displayed here, due to confidentiality reasons.

I hereby thank them for allowing me to display the work i have done.

# Quick TLDR of your internship ?
Being dispatched to *GazTransport & Technigaz*, a well known engineering French firm specialized in LNG carriers' tank, I have :
* Implemented the POC (Proof of Concept) of an AI to automatically detect errors in engineering drawings ;
  * Review of that State of the Art
  * Created multiple datasets ;
  * Implemented the AI ;
  * Trained the AI using distributed methods on the firm's cluster ;
* Implemented software testing ;

# What were the results ?
Due to the time available and the difficulties encountered, the POC was not completed by the time I left, but the results were promising!

# POC Not completed means that you either slacked off or that you're not that good no ?...
Neither of those! In fact, my tutor was really satisfied with my work, and I received the highest grade possible for both my internship and oral presentation ;)
